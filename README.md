# Sokoban AI Planning Agent

This project was completed as part of the CAB320 Artificial Intelligence unit at QUT.

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a motion planning agent for the classic puzzle game **Sokoban**, where an AI agent must push weighted boxes to goal positions in a warehouse-like environment. The goal is to minimize the cost of moves using informed search strategies.

## 📁 Contents

- `mySokobanSolver.ipynb` — the core implementation of the AI solver.
- `report.pdf` — the project report explaining the methodology, heuristics, testing, and performance.
- (Optional) `example_puzzles/` — sample warehouse puzzle text files.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- A* Search, Heuristic Design
- GUI provided (not included here)

## 🎯 Key Features

- Custom state representation for efficient search
- Heuristic function based on Manhattan distances and weights
- Cost-based action evaluation (1 + box weight)
- Compliance with assignment framework

## 📝 Notes

This project was conducted individually/in a team (update as appropriate). For privacy, only selected files are included.
